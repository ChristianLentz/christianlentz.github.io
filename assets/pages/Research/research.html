      <h3 id="prh-alg">Exact and Stable Computation of Persistent Relative Homology</h3>
        <p>
          Working under Drs. <a href="https://www.loriziegelmeier.com/">Lori Ziegelmeier</a> and Gregory Henselman-Petrusek (PNNL), I
          have developed a novel algorithm for the direct computation of persistent relative homology. Utilizing a recently presented 
          <a href="https://arxiv.org/abs/2108.08831">matrix factorization scheme</a>, our method can compute cycle representatives and 
          persistence modules for a pair of topological spaces equipped with arbitrary filtrations. The only restriction on these filtrations 
          is that the inclusion of spaces be preserved at each level. To our knowledge, there are no existing algorithms to perform this 
          calculation. Further, the only existing method for computing persistent relative homology places heavy restrictions on the filtrations, 
          and is indirect in that it only computes a persistence diagram summary. I am presently the lead author on a manuscript in preparation 
          which proves the correctness and stability of our method. As an undergradute, I completed an honors thesis related to this work, 
          which can be viewed at the links below.

      <h3 id="prh-oat">Persistent Relative Homology for Data Science</h3>
        <p>
          Related to the project above, I am currently working as the sole author of a software module to implement a flexible method 
          for persistent relative homology with an emphasis on applications in TDA and data science. The implementation is written in low-level 
          <a href="https://www.rust-lang.org/">Rust</a> for performance purposes, and is complete with Python bindings in the 
          <a href="https://github.com/pnnl/oat_pnnl">Open Applied Topology (OAT)</a> project. The code utilizes modern data structures for matrix 
          algebra which not only compress sparse matrices, but lazily generate their rows and columns on an as-needed basis, allowing this algorithm 
          to circumvent major memory use choke-points that have previously plagued algorithms in applied topology. The images below give a simple 
          example of our algorithm in action during its early stages of implementation and testing.

      <h3 id="conway-gol">Evolving Mobile Agents in Conwayâ€™s Game of Life</h3>
        <p>
          This project was completed as my computer science capstone during the Fall of 2023, when I took an introductory
          course in Artificial Intelligence with my academic advisor <a href="https://sites.google.com/macalester.edu/susan-fox-profile/home">Susan Fox</a>. 
          Using the popular cellular automaton <a href="https://conwaylife.com/wiki/Conway%27s_Game_of_Life">Conway's Game of Life</a>, 
          we investigated to capacity for agents (or cell tilings) within the game to exhibit emergent or intelligent behavior. 
          The explicit goal was to write a genetic algorithm which, given a randomly generated popualtion of cell tilings, could 
          be used to evolve subsequent generations of cell tilings which are capable of directed growth and movement. Our 
          genetic algorithm is implemented in Python and required the NumPy library and elementary linear algebra in order 
          to assess the behavior and fitness of the population. The project also includes a front-end animation built with 
          Matplotlib. Check out the links below to see the project in more detail.

        <p>
          This project was completed as my mathematics capstone during the Fall of 2023, when I took a math modeling
          course with <a href="https://sites.google.com/macalester.edu/willmitchell/home?pli=1">Will Mitchell</a>. This
          was primarily an investigation of numerical techniques for approximating solutions to partial
          differential equations, and in particular finite differences and the Fourier spectral method. I studied each of
          these techniques using the wave equation, and implemented both. Check out the links below to see my work in
