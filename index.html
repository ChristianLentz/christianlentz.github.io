    <section class="content">
      <p>I am a recent graduate of Macalester College in St. Paul, Minnesota where I obtained BAs in both 
        Mathematics and Computer Science. I am a lifelong learner and am always ready to take on a new challenge 
        or learn a new skill. I have recently relocated to the greater Boston area and am looking to begin my career. 
        I am open to various positions and am eager to apply my programming and mathematics skills. I am particularly 
        passionate about topics in algorithms, theoretical computer science, AI and machine learning, and 
        mathematics including algebra, analysis and topology. Check out 
        <a href="files/ChristianLentz_CV.pdf">my CV</a> to learn more about my background.

        <h3 id="prh-tda">Persistent Relative Homology for TDA</h3>
          <h4 id="prh-tda-date">05/2023 - present</h4>
            <h5 id="prh-tda-description">Honors Research</h5>
              <p>
                This project started as a research assistantship during the summer of 2023 with my academic advisor <a
                href="https://www.loriziegelmeier.com/">Lori Ziegelmeier</a>, and Greg Henselman-Petrusek of Pacific Northwest National 
                Laboratory. In recent years, persistent homology has become an increasingly popular technique in applied topology and 
                topological data analysis (TDA). Our work describes a new approach to compute a variant known as persistent relative homolgy. 
                My work has contributed to all aspects of this project including the developemnt of the algorithm, research and literature 
                review. My technical contributions include a proof of correctness and stability. The algorithm will soon be implemented 
                in the <a href="https://meetings.ams.org/math/jmm2024/meetingapp.cgi/Paper/33362">Open Applied Topology (OAT)</a> project 
                using the Rust programming language. I have presented this research at multiple conferences including the Mathematical 
                Association of America NCS and the <a href="https://meetings.ams.org/math/jmm2024/meetingapp.cgi/Paper/30153">2024 Joint Mathematics Meetings</a>. 
                I also defended this research for my honors thesis at Macalester College. Check out the links below to see the project in 
                more detail.

            <h5 id="digit-recognizer-description"> Personal Project </h5>
              <p>
                This was a brief personal project inspired by a homework assignment in my undergraduate numerical analysis course. 
                Using a dataset containing nearly 10,000 images of handwritten digits (0-9), I wrote two machine learning algorithms to 
                classify the images. The first algorithm uses a Least Squares approach, and is implemented in three different ways
                including via the normal equations, the built in QR algorithm in R, and via the Singular Value Decomposition. The other 
                approach uses the Low Rank Approximation via the Singular Value Decomposition. Check out the project below.

            <h5 id="conway-gol-description">Artificial Intelligence Capstone </h5>
              <p>
                This project was completed as my computer science capstone during the Fall of 2023, when I took an introductory
                course in Artificial Intelligence with my academic advisor <a href="https://sites.google.com/macalester.edu/susan-fox-profile/home">Susan Fox</a>. 
                Using the popular cellular automaton <a href="https://conwaylife.com/wiki/Conway%27s_Game_of_Life">Conway's Game of Life</a>, 
                we investigated to capacity for agents (or cell tilings) within the game to exhibit emergent or intelligent behavior. 
                The explicit goal was to write a genetic algorithm which, given a randomly generated popualtion of cell tilings, could 
                be used to evolve subsequent generations of cell tilings which are capable of directed growth and movement. Our 
                genetic algorithm is implemented in Python and required the NumPy library and elementary linear algebra in order 
                to assess the behavior and fitness of the population. The project also includes a front-end animation built with 
                Matplotlib. Check out the links below to see the project in more detail.
