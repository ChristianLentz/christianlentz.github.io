      <h1 id="about-me">About Me</h1>
      <p>I am a recent graduate of Macalester College in St. Paul, Minnesota where I obtained BAs in both 
        Mathematics and Computer Science. I am a lifelong learner and am always ready to take on a new challenge 
        or learn a new skill. I have recently relocated to the greater Boston area and am looking to begin my career. 
        I am open to various positions and am eager to apply my programming and mathematics skills. I am particularly 
        passionate about topics in algorithms, theoretical computer science, AI and machine learning, and 
        mathematics including algebra, analysis and topology. If you are interested in my work experience or wish to 
        contact me, then check out <a href="files/ChristianLentz_CV.pdf">my CV</a>. If you want to know a bit about 
        my educational background, then checkout <a href="files/MacalesterTranscript.pdf">my undergraduate transcript</a>.</p>

        <h2 id="prh-tda">Persistent Relative Homology for 
        Topological Data Analysis | 05/2023 - present</h2>
          <h3 id="honors-research">Macalester College Honors Research</h3>
          <p>This project started as a research assistantship during the summer of 2023 with my academic advisor <a
          href="https://www.loriziegelmeier.com/">Lori Ziegelmeier</a>, and Greg Henselman-Petrusek of Pacific Northwest National 
          Laboratory. Persistent homology is a key tool in applied topology and TDA, and our work provides 
          an alternative approach to compute a variant known as persistent relative homolgy. My work has contributed to all aspects 
          of this project, including the developemnt of the algorithm itself as well as research and literature review. My technical 
          contributions include a proof of correctness and stability. Soon, the algorithm will be implemented in the Open Applied 
          Topology (OAT) project using the Rust programming language. I have spoken about this research at the 2023 Fall Meeting of 
          the Mathematical Association of America’s North Central Section, and at the AIM-AMS Special Session on <em>Applied Topology 
          Beyond Persistence Diagrams</em> (see the presentation <a href="/files/PRH_slides_JMM.pdf">here</a>) at the 2024 Joint 
          Mathematics Meetings. I also wrote a paper and defended this work for my honors thesis at Macalester College. See the presentation 
          <a href="/files/PRH_slides_honors.pdf">here</a> and the paper <a href="/files/MSCS_HonorsThesis_ChristianLentz.pdf">here</a>.

        <h2 id="digit-recognizer"> Digit Classififcation Algorithm | 05/2024 </h2>
          <h3 id="personal-proj-digits"> Personal Project </h3>
          <p>
            This was a brief personal project inspired by a homework assignment in my undergraduate numerical analysis course. 
            Using a dataset containing nearly 10,000 images of handwritten digits (0-9), I wrote two machine learning algorithms to 
            classify the images. The first algorithm uses a Least Squares approach, and is implemented in three different ways
            including via the normal equations, the built in QR algorithm in R, and via the Singular Value Decomposition. The other 
            approach uses the Low Rank Approximation via the Singular Value Decomposition. Click 
            <a href="/pages/DigitRecognizer.html"> here </a> to see the project.

          <h3 id="ai-capstone">Macalester College Artificial Intelligence Capstone </h3>
            <p>This project was completed as my computer science capstone during the Fall of 2023, when I took an introductory
            course in Artificial Intelligence with my academic advisor <a
            href="https://sites.google.com/macalester.edu/susan-fox-profile/home">Susan Fox</a>. This project was an
            investigation of cellular automaton, artificial life and genetic algorithms. The explicit goal was
            to evolve a population of random seeds to behave similar to glider tilings. Check out this <a
            href="https://github.com/ChristianLentz/MobileTilingsGOL">github repository</a> to see our
            implementation in Python, and <a href="/files/IntroToAI_paper.pdf">this paper</a> detailing our work.</p>

        <h2 id="wave-eqn">Numerical Techniques for the Wave Equation | 10/2023 - 12/2023</h2>
          <h3 id="math-capstone">Macalester College Mathematical Modeling Capstone</h3>
            <p>This project was completed as my mathematics capstone during the Fall of 2023, when I took a math modeling
            course with <a href="https://sites.google.com/macalester.edu/willmitchell/home?pli=1">Will Mitchell</a>. This
            was primarily an investigation of numerical techniques for approximating solutions to partial
            differential equations, and in particular finite differences and the Fourier spectral method. I studied each of
            these techniques using the wave equation, and implemented both. Check out this <a
            href="https://github.com/ChristianLentz/Math437Capstone">github repository</a> to see my implementation in
            Python and <a href="/files/mathModeling_paper.pdf">this paper</a> which describes my work in more detail.</p>

          <h3 id="software-dev">Macalester College Software Development Course</h3>
          <p>This project was built for my software development course at Macalester College, and provides a space for
            Macalester students and faculty to buy, sell and trade used goods at little-to-no cost. The project was built
            using vanilla JavaScript, HTML, CSS, npm for package mangement, the Google Firebase SDK for backend services 
            including the <em>Firestore</em> NoSQL database and Webpack CLI for module bundling. Check out the repository 
            <a href="https://github.com/ChristianLentz/comp225-project-team-Jachris/tree/main">here</a>.</p>

          <h3 id="algs-course">Macalester College Algorithms Course</h3>
          <p>This project was a rather brief introduction to and exploration of popular triangulation algorithms for convex
          polygons. This served as a culminating project to my introductory algorithms course at Macalester College, and
          was my first experience writing a research-style paper. The project includes an
          implementtion of the ear-clipping algorithm using quick-hull and selection sort in Java. Check out this
          <a href="https://github.com/ChristianLentz/Triangulator">github repository</a> to see
          our implementation, and <a href="files/TriangulationPaper.pdf">this file</a> to see the paper.

          <h3 id="systems-course">Macalester College Computer Systems Course</h3>
          <p>This is a classic project for undergraduate computer science students and was a culminating project/homework for 
            my computer systems course at Macalester College. This project exemplifies my understanding of the C programming 
            language and allowed me to apply a number of skills and techniques that I learned in computer systems, including 
            array usage and allocation, pointer math, and the basics of parallel processes. Check out the repository 
            <a href="https://github.com/ChristianLentz/LinuxShell">here</a>.
