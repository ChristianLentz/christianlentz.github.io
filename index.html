      <h1 id="about-me">About Me</h1>
      <p>I am a recent graduate of Macalester College in St. Paul, Minnesota where I obtained BAs in both 
        Mathematics and Computer Science. My ultimate goal is to obtain a PhD. As a next step toward this goal, 
        I am looking to embark on my first job post-graduation. I have a strong background in computer science as well as pure
        and applied mathematics, and am looking to expand my skills and network with real-world work experience. This website 
        highlights my research interests and skills as well as some of the projects that I have completed during my time as 
        an undergraduate student. If you are interested in my work experience or wish to contact me, then check out 
        <a href="files/ChristianLentz_CV.pdf">my CV</a>.</p> 

      <h1 id="research-interests">Research Interests</h1>
      <p> Through my educational expereinces I have found that I most enjoy sudying algorithms, theoretical computer science 
        and pure mathematics, including algebra, analysis and topology. On the other hand, my research interests and experience 
        lie at the intersection of mathematics and computer science. For this reason, my work and research interests include
        machine learning, applied topology and numerical analysis. Some of the projects that I have highlighted on this website
        exemplify the work that I have done in these areas. </p>

        <h2 id="prh-tda">Persistent Relative Homology for 
        Topological Data Analysis | 05/2023 - present</h2>
          <h3 id="honors-research">Macalester College Honors Research</h3>
          <p>This project started as a research assistantship during the summer of 2023 with my academic advisor <a
          href="https://www.loriziegelmeier.com/">Lori Ziegelmeier</a>, and
          <a href="https://www.gregoryhenselman.org/index.html">Greg Henselman-Petrusek</a> of Pacific Northwest National 
          Laboratory. Persistent homology is a key tool in the field of Topological Data Analysis, and our work provides 
          an alternative approach to compute a variant known as persistent relative homolgy. My work has contributed to all aspects 
          of this project, including the developemnt of the algorithm itself as well as research and literature review. My technical 
          contributions include a proof of correctness and stability. Soon, the algorithm will be implemented in the Open Applied 
          Topology (OAT) project. I have spoken about this research at the 2023 Fall Meeting of the Mathematical Association of 
          America’s North Central Section, and at the AIM-AMS Special Session on <em>Applied Topology Beyond Persistence Diagrams</em> 
          (see the presentation <a href="/files/PRH_slides_JMM.pdf">here</a>) at the 2024 Joint Mathematics Meetings. I also wrote 
          a paper and defended this work for my honors thesis at Macalester College. See the presentation 
          <a href="/files/PRH_slides_honors.pdf">here</a> and the paper <a href="/files/MSCS_HonorsThesis_ChristianLentz.pdf">here</a>.

          <h3 id="ai-capstone">Macalester College Artificial Intelligence Capstone </h3>
            <p>This project was completed as my computer science capstone during the Fall of 2023, when I took an introductory
            course in Artificial Intelligence with my academic advisor <a
            href="https://sites.google.com/macalester.edu/susan-fox-profile/home">Susan Fox</a>. This project was an
            investigation of cellular automaton, artificial life and genetic algorithms. The explicit goal was
            to evolve a population of random seeds to behave similar to glider tilings. Check out this <a
            href="https://github.com/comp484-IntroToAI/project-ana-christian">github repository</a> to see our
            implementation in Python, and <a href="/files/IntroToAI_paper.pdf">this paper</a> detailing our work.</p>

        <h2 id="wave-eqn">Numerical Techniques for the Wave Equation | 10/2023 - 12/2023</h2>
          <h3 id="math-capstone">Macalester College Mathematical Modeling Capstone</h3>
            <p>This project was completed as my mathematics capstone during the Fall of 2023, when I took a math modeling
            course with <a href="https://sites.google.com/macalester.edu/willmitchell/home?pli=1">Will Mitchell</a>. This
            was primarily an investigation of numerical techniques for approximating solutions to partial
            differential equations, and in particular finite differences and the Fourier spectral method. I studied each of
            these techniques using the wave equation, and implemented both. Check out this <a
            href="https://github.com/ChristianLentz/Math437Capstone">github repository</a> to see my implementation in
            Python and <a href="/files/mathModeling_paper.pdf">this paper</a> which describes my work in more detail.</p>

        <h2 id="trade-center">Mac Virtual Trade Center | 09/2023 - 12/2023</h2>
          <h3 id="software-dev">Macalester College Software Development Course</h3>
          <p>This project was built for my software development course at Macalester College, and provides a space for
            Macalester students and faculty to buy, sell and trade used goods at little-to-no cost. The project was built
            using vanilla JavaScript, HTML, CSS, the Google Firebase SDK for backend services and Webpack CLI for module
            bundling. Check out the repository 
            <a href="https://github.com/ChristianLentz/comp225-project-team-Jachris/tree/main">here</a>.</p>

          <h3 id="algs-course">Macalester College Algorithms Course</h3>
          <p>This project was a rather brief introduction to and exploration of popular triangulation algorithms for convex
          polygons. This served as a culminating project to my introductory algorithms course at Macalester College, and
          was my first experience writing a research-style paper. The project includes an
          implementtion of the ear-clipping algorithm using quick-hull and selection sort in Java. Check out this
          <a href="https://github.com/Comp-221-Macalester/algorithms-project-nolan-christian">github repository</a> to see
          our implementation, and <a href="files/TriangulationPaper.pdf">this file</a> to see the paper.
