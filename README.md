# About Me

I am a recent graduate of Macalester College in St. Paul, Minnesota where I obtained BAs in both Mathematics and Computer Science. Through my educational expereinces I have found that I most enjoy sudying algorithms, theoretical computer science and pure mathematics, including algebra, analysis and topology. My work and research interests lie at the intersection of mathematics and computer science, including machine learning, applied topology and numerical analysis. This website highlights some of the projects that I have 
completed during my time as an undergraduate student. If you are interested in my work experience or wish to contact me, then check out [my CV](files/ChristianLentz_CV.pdf).
