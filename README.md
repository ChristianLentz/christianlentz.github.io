# About Me

I am a recent graduate of Macalester College in St. Paul, Minnesota where I obtained BAs in both Mathematics and Computer Science. My ultimate goal is to obtain a PhD. As a next step toward this goal, 
I am looking to embark on my first job post-graduation. I have a strong background in computer science as well as pure and applied mathematics, and am looking to expand my skills and network with real-world work experience. This website highlights my research interests and skills as well as some of the projects that I have completed during my time as an undergraduate student. If you are interested in my work experience or wish to contact me, then check out [my CV](files/ChristianLentz_CV.pdf).
