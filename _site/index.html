      <h1 id="about-me">About Me</h1>
      <p>I am a current undergraduate student at Macalester College in St. Paul, Minnesota. I have nearly finished my BA
        in Mathematics and Computer Science and hope to attend graduate school as a next step towards a career in
        research and academia. This website highlights my research interests and some of the projects that I have
        completed during my time as an undergraduate. If you are interested in my research/work experience or wish to
        contact me, then check out <a href="/ChristianLentz_CV.pdf">my CV</a>.</p>

      <h1 id="research-interests">Research Interests</h1>
      <p>I am most interested in continued study and research in artificial intelligence, algorithms and theoretical
        computer science and pure mathematics, including algebra and topology. My ultimate goal is to apply knowledge
        from these areas in computational topology and machine learning in order to understand how to create new and
        efficient ways of understanding and analyzing data.</p>

        Persistent Relative Homology | 05/2023 - present</h2>
      <h3 id="macalester-college-honors-research">Macalester College Honors Research</h3>
      <p>This project started as a research assistanship during the summer of 2023 with my academic advisor <a
          href="https://www.loriziegelmeier.com/">Lori Ziegelmeier</a>. The goal of this project was to use recently
        presented matrix factorizations to develop a flexible and efficient method for computing persistent relative
        homology which can be used to compute a barcode, but also allows for expeditious extraction of homological
        generators. Presently, we are working to prove stability of the algorithm in addition to providing an
        implementation in the Open Applied Topology (OAT) project. I have spoken about this research at the 2023 Fall
        Meeting of the Mathematical Association of America’s North Central Section, and will present at the AIM-AMS
        Special Session on <em>Applied Topology Beyond Persistence Diagrams</em> at the 2024 Joint Mathematics Meetings.
        There is a paper in preparation currently.</p>

      </h3>
      <p>This project was completed as my computer science capstone during the Fall of 2023, when I took an introductory
        course in Artificial Intelligence with my academic advisor <a
          href="https://sites.google.com/macalester.edu/susan-fox-profile/home">Susan Fox</a>. This project was an
        investigation of cellular automaton, artificial life, local search and genetic algorithms. The explicit goal was
        to evolve a population of random seeds to behave similar to glider tilings. Check out this <a
          href="https://github.com/comp484-IntroToAI/project-ana-christian">github repository</a> to see our
        implementation in Python and a brief paper detailing our work.</p>

      <h3 id="macalester-college-mathematical-modeling-capstone">Macalester College Mathematical Modeling Capstone</h3>
      <p>This project was completed as my mathematics capstone during the Fall of 2023, when I took a math modeling
        course with <a href="https://sites.google.com/macalester.edu/willmitchell/home?pli=1">Will Mitchell</a>. This
        project was primarily an investigation of numerical techniques for approximating solutions to partial
        differential equations. In particular, I used finite differences and Fourier spectral methods to model waves
        with periodic boundary conditions, and implemented simple swimmer agents to navigate the environment. Check out
        this <a href="https://github.com/ChristianLentz/Math437Capstone">github repository</a> to see my implementation
        in Python as well as a Jupyter notebook which describes the project in more detail.</p>

      <h3 id="macalester-college-software-development-course">Macalester College Software Development Course</h3>
      <p>This project was built for my software development course at Macalester College, and provides a space for
        Macalester students and faculty to buy, sell and trade used goods at little-to-no cost. The project was built
        using vanilla JavaScript, HTML, CSS and the Google Firebase SDK for backend services. Check out the repository
        <a href="https://github.com/ChristianLentz/comp225-project-team-Jachris/tree/main">here</a>.

      <h3 id="macalester-college-algorithms-course">Macalester College Algorithms Course</h3>
      <p>This project was a rather brief introduction to and exploration of popular triangulation algorithms for convex
        polygons. This served as a culminating project to my introductory algorithms course at Macalester College, and
        was my first experience writing a research-style paper. The project includes a github repository with an
        implementtion of the ear-clipping algorithm using quick hull and selection sort in Java. Check out the project
        and the paper <a href="https://github.com/Comp-221-Macalester/algorithms-project-nolan-christian">here</a>.</p>
